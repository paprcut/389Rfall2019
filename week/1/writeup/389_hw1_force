*Discovering a key flaw in ECU firmware that could potentially endanger lives would certainly be a difficult situation, especially for a junior developer.  If I found myself in this situation, the first thing I would do would be to inform my superiors right away.  When discussing the issue with my bosses, I would make it clear that while my intentions are good and that I want what's best for the company, I will do everything in my power to ensure the firmware is not allowed to endanger lives, even if that means blowing the whistle.  Hopefully my superiors would agree that safety must be our primary concern, even if it means adding another 6 months to development.

If my bosses were to put me down and choose to repress the information, though, I feel I would have no choice but to report the issue to a consumer watchdog.  The main reason that I would go to a watchdog as opposed to the general public is because in the event that the firmware makes it to production anyway, I would not want any members of the public with malicious intent to know about the flaw and attempt to exploit it.  For that reason, I would go to a responsible public watchdog with the information.

In all likelihood, going to the watchdog with information of the firmware error would almost certainly cost my job.  While less than ideal, I feel that anybody in this situation has an ethical responsibility to do everything in their power to ensure the broken firmware does not endanger human life, even if it means losing his or her job.  I cannot imagine how I would feel if I were to keep quiet and then learn that people had died because of the issue.  This is why ethics are so important in the industry and beyond.*
