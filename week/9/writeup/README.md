## Assignment details

### Part 1 (45 Pts)

1. The IP address being attacked is 159.203.113.181.

2. The main attacking tool being used is a port scanning tool similar to nmap.  This is evident due to the 'RST' being
sent back to the server, and the continous pinging of a ton of different ports.

3. The attack is coming from IP 142.93.136.81.  According to an online locator I used, the attack is coming from the
Netherlands.

4. The attackers seem to be using the FTP port to steal data.

5. I'm not sure what type of file they stole, but whatever it was it seemed to be some sort of directory listing.

6. The attackers left behind a picture titled 'find_me.jpeg' and another file called greetz.fpff.

7. Ideally, they would put some sort of firewall in place that would be able to recognize the port scanning and put
a stop to it.

### Part 2 (55 Pts)

Unfortunately, I was unable to complete this part of the assignment.
